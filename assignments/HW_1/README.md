# Problem Set 1 

## Learning Objectives 

- Write many model against data
- Evaluate model assumptions and diagnostics 
- Produce a legible, constrained analysis of real data 

## Task 

In this problem set you are going to modify code that has been presented to you in async, estimate several different models against data, and even write your own maximum likelihood estimator. This is a chance to put the theory that we have developed into action and estimate, report, and think about a series of models and those models coefficients. 

## Method of Submitting 

You must submit a PDF of your compiled analysis and your code (.rmd) to Gradescope. 

## Guidance for your work

- There is no page limit -- and there is no page requirement. And so, be suscinct, but complete in your analysis and reporting. There is no reason to modify fontsize, margins, or line spacing, so please don't!  
- Each student needs to complete their own assignment. We encourage you to work together as a study group, but this should be a collaborative environment where every member of that group is made better by every other member's presence. Students are expected to act with regard to UC Berkeley Academic Integrity
  - This means that you should not simply share code without collaborating on it. 
  - This means that people who are working as a study group have to all participate. 
- Answers should clearly explain your reasoning; do not simply 'output dump' the results of code without explanation. You have to create an argument, and written narrative that describes your thinking: Why have you done what you have done? What do you hope to learn from it? What have you actually learned?  
- Using libraries: 
  - You may use any part of the `tidyverse` and you may also use `data.table` for data wrangling. 
  - You may use any library that is presented in the course for the statistical analysis.
  - But, try to constrain yourselves from searching out *that one other library* that does one task. Instead, write that yourself! 
- For mathematical formulae, type them in your R markdown file, using the correct $\LaTeX$. There are enough examples of success with this, that you can do it. 
- Use inline code evaluation to print results from objects into the printed page.
