## Case Study: National Election Survey

### Introduction

ANES provides data that help explain election outcomes by supporting detailed hypothesis testing, measuring multiple variables, and promoting comparisons across people, contexts, and time. (ANES)

> In this exercise, we want to study how the evaluation of President Obama depends on voters’ demographic characteristics such as gender, race, and age.


### Data Description

The data was obtained from the **American National Election Survey**, which conducted a survey several months prior to the 2016 American Presidential elections.

The dataset “*voters.csv*” contains a handful of variables from the survey, and these variables have been cleaned and modified for this exercise.


This dataset contains the following variables:

  - Presjob: Respondents’ evaluation of President Obama(Approve, Neutral, Not Approve)
  - age: (Respondents’ age, as of 2016)
  - race_white: Dummy variable taking a value of one if the respondent is white and is zero otherwise.
  - female: Dummy variable taking a value of one if the respondent is female and is zero otherwise.

\newpage

### Descriptive Statistics

- First, load and check the data set and discuss its structure 

- Discuss missing values and how you would typically handle them at work

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

df <- read.csv("./data/voters.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = TRUE, sep = ",")

head(df) %>%
  knitr::kable()
#str(df)
#describe(df)

## rows with NA
#df[!complete.cases(df),]
# counts NA in each column
#sapply(df, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

# Keep only the complete cases in the dataset
df2 <- df[complete.cases(df),]
### Reorder the categories of presjob and convert female, and race_white to factor

df2 <- df2 %>%
  mutate(
    race_white = factor(race_white),
    female = factor(female),
    presjob = factor(presjob)
      )
# Attach the dataset
attach(df2)
```

\newpage

#### Univariate Analysis

- The response (or dependent) variable of interest, President evaluation, is a categorical variable with three levels. 

- Use a barplot to examine the response variable. What do you learn about the President's evaluation?
```{r}
p1<- df2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= presjob, y = ..prop.., group = 1)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = 'DarkBlue', color = 'black') +
  geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=round(..prop..,2)), vjust=-1) + 
  xlab("President Evaluation") +
  ylab("Proportion") +
  ylim(0,1)

p1
```

- Use the following command to produce a barplot for race and gender. What do you discover?

```{r}

p2<- df2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= race_white, y = ..prop.., group = 1)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = 'DarkBlue', color = 'black') +
  geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=round(..prop..,2)), vjust=-1) + 
  xlab("Race") +
  ylab("Proportion") +
  ylim(0,1)

p3<- df2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= female, y = ..prop.., group = 1)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = 'DarkBlue', color = 'black') +
  geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=round(..prop..,2)), vjust=-1) + 
  xlab("Gender") +
  ylab("Proportion") +
  ylim(0,1)



grid.arrange(p2, p3, nrow = 1, ncol = 2)

```


- Use the following command to create a density plot ofage. What do you think about the distribution of age?

```{r}
p4 <- df2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) +
  geom_density(aes(y = ..density.., color = presjob, fill = presjob),alpha=0.2) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Respondents' Age") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=1, face="bold")) +
  xlab("Yaer") +
  ylab("Density")

p4
```

\newpage

#### Bivariate Analysis

- Examine the simple associations between the president's evaluation and each explanatory variable. How are these variables correlated?

```{r}
p5 <- df2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=race_white, 
             y = ..prop.., 
             group = presjob,
             fill = presjob)) + 
  geom_bar( position = 'dodge') +
  geom_text(stat='count', 
            aes(label=round(..prop..,2)), 
            vjust=-1, 
            position = position_dodge(width = 1)) +
  xlab("Race") +
  ylab("Proportion") +
  ylim(0,1) +
  labs(fill = "presjob")

p6 <- df2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=female, 
             y = ..prop.., 
             group = presjob,
             fill = presjob)) + 
  geom_bar( position = 'dodge') +
  geom_text(stat='count', 
            aes(label=round(..prop..,2)), 
            vjust=-1, 
            position = position_dodge(width = 1)) +
  xlab("Gender") +
  ylab("Proportion") +
  ylim(0,1) +
  labs(fill = "presjob")
grid.arrange(p5, p6, nrow = 2, ncol = 1)
```

```{r}
p7 <- df2 %>%
 ggplot(aes(presjob, age)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = presjob)) + 
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Respondents’ age, as of 2016") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=1, face="bold")) +
  ylab("Age") +
  xlab("President Evaluation") 

p7
```

\newpage

- Use summary_factorlist() function from the finalfit package to tabulate data. What do you learn about the relationship between the president's evaluation and these variables?

```{r}
dependent <- "presjob"
explanatory <- c("race_white", "female", "age")
df %>% 
  summary_factorlist(dependent, explanatory, add_dependent_label = TRUE) %>%
  knitr::kable()

```

\newpage

### Model Development

#### $I*J$ Contigency table and Test for Independence

 - In this section, we would like to determine if the president's evaluation is related to the following variables:

  - Race
  - Gender

 
Create a contingency table and test for independence to make this determination. Recall that the hypothesis for the test is:

$H_0: \pi_{ij} = \pi{i+}*\pi_{+j}$

$H_a: \pi_{ij}\neq \pi{i+}*\pi_{+j}$


- When independence is rejected, examine the association between the president's evaluation and the explanatory variable using the model residual.


```{r}

## president evaluation and race

tab1 <- df2 %>%
  group_by(race_white,presjob) %>%
  count() %>%
  xtabs(formula = n ~ race_white + presjob)
#tab1

## chi-square test
#test1<- # uncomment and replace with your code
#test1$stdres

```

```{r}

## president evaluation and gender

tab2 <- df2 %>%
  group_by(female,presjob) %>%
  count() %>%
  xtabs(formula = n ~ female + presjob)
tab2
## chi-square test
#test2 <- # uncomment and replace with your code
#test2$stdres  # uncomment 



```

\newpage


#### Nominal response regression model

- In this part, we use regression modeling to assess the association between the variables more systematically. 

- Estimate the following model and interpret the results.


$$ log(\frac{\pi_j}{\pi_1}) =\beta_{j0} + \beta_{j1} race+ \beta_{j2} female + \beta_{j3} age +  u$$

```{r}
#mod.nomial <- # uncomment and replace with your code
#summary(mod.nomial)

```

- Perform a Wald test to assess if the coefficients are statistically significant.  

$H_0:\beta_{jr} = 0$ 

$H_a:\beta_{jr}\neq 0$ 


```{r}
#z_score <- # uncomment and replace with your code
#z_score # uncomment 
```

- Perform LRT to explore if a given explanatory variable $x_r$ is statistically significant over all response categories.

$H_0:\beta_{2r}=\beta_{3r}=0$ 

$H_a:\beta_{2r}\neq 0 \quad or \quad  \beta_{3r} \neq 0$ 

```{r}
# Replace with your code
```

- Estimate and interpret the following odd ratios from estimated model for each explanatory variable($\widehat{OR} = exp(c*\beta_{jr})$)
  - Approve vs. Neutral   
  - Approve vs. Not Approve

```{r}
#Approve vs. Neutral   

# Replace with your code

#Approve vs. Not Approve

# Replace with your code

```

- Construct Wald confidence intervals for the odds ratios.
 
```{r}
## compute CI for the coefficients

# Replace with your code

## construct CI for OR

# Replace with your code
```
 
\newpage

#### Ordinal response regression models

- The high approval rate before the election is a critical factor in any election. So the 'Not approve" is less desirable than "Neutral" and "Approve."

- Estimate and interpret following model using the ordering of "Not Approve"(Y=1) < "Neutral" (y=2) < "Approve" (Y=3).    
 
$$ logit(P(Y 	\leq j)) =\beta_{j0} + \beta_{j1} race_white+ \beta_{j2} female + \beta_{j3} age +  u$$ 
 
```{r}
## create required ordering
df2$presjob.order <- factor(presjob, levels = c("Not Approve", "Neutral", "Approve"))
attach(df2)
levels(presjob.order)

### estimate the model

#mod.ord <- # uncomment and replace with your code
#summary(mod.ord) # uncomment 


```
 
- How could we perform a Wald test to assess if the coefficients are statistically significant?  


- Construct and interpret the odds ratios for each explanatory variable ($\widehat{OR} = exp(c*\beta_{jr})$).

```{r}
# Replace with your code
```

- Construct LR confidence interval for the odds ratios.

```{r}
# first compute the coefficients CI

# Replace with your code

## construct OR CI

# Replace with your code


```
